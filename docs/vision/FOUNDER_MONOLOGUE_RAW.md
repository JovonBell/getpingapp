# Founder Monologue - Raw Context (December 2024)

> Preserved verbatim for future reference. This captures the founder's unfiltered vision.

## On Rings/Tiers

"i think the closest tiers are meant to be your closest people, so sort of frequency based, but the user can sort of choose it to be family if they feel that is closest, or name it something else to include their S.O, certain friends, etc. I think people can move between tiers, but i'd bet its rare. i would also bet that you can have a person in multiple circles, and i would love to make it almost spherical in the way that you can rotate the circles on the other axis as well. within ping, i think theyll be referred to as rings."

---

## On Growth Beyond Phone Imports

"you would grow circles beyond phone imports as you meet people out and about at events, networking, startups, art events, on the subway, at museums. the ring itself (the hardware product that pairs with this software), has nfc chip with your ping profile encoded so that you can tap it to people's iphones."

---

## On User Value Progression

"the idea is to get most people to get started on the software, and for them to find enough returning value in visualizing their network and then eventually being able to take action through the app to take agency to grow their network towards certain goals. thus the rule of 6 connections (its called something), but the idea that you can make certain peripheral or collateral connections, and use them as connection points toward a further place in the future. thus why linkedin data, linking in apple data/personal contact data, and deep web people search are key. as well as other data sources to basically have an AI companion for this person."

---

## On Poke Inspiration

"to get an understanding of how the ping assistant would work, I would like you to look up 'poke' by interaction. it is an ai that does a great job at creating a more human understanding. understand their backend and user interaction, and why people love it. there is stuff on their site, reddit, and more of the web. they allow you to connect data sources via mcp. their biggest innovation is how they handle memory. but the ping ai agent should be sort of brilliant in how it makes connections."

---

## On The Core Problem

"the founder of ping's main goal/stated problem is that 85% of connections never follow up/maintain the connection. linkedin doesnt actually fulfill that problem. going deeper, the root of that we feel is that there is limited time to convey/collect enough information to make a real connection on something interesting. like both being in the same industry and both liking basketball is cool sure, but its not really deep."

---

## On Reece's Superpower

"the founder of ping, my friend reece, asks the most interesting and out of the box/surprising ideas that i see at events really put people on their back foot for a second. they are questions that really make a person step back and think, and also really makes them think for a second - who is this guy? as he sits there with a smile."

---

## On The Ping AI Agent Vision

"now, poke's agent is great, but its sort of just continuously snarky. i think if we can grab up the right set of tools, and take some inspiration from how they handle memory, the ping agent could help people ask better questions or say just the right (maybe even controversial/risky comments) that evoke an emotional and thoughtful interaction that makes a stronger bond."

---

## On Continuous Value

"and then its continuous agency through the app living on your phone and through this continuous network of people allows you to strengthen not EVERY bond, but the bonds you realize you actually care about. as i've stated, i think its actually not super useful over time to simply 'visualize' your network of rings, or to continuously follow up with certain connections. i think there is a real reason that after a while certain connections die out or one forgets them, and maybe its because you dont actually need to be talking to that specific friend all the time. you spend the most time with your best friends because they bring you some sort of value. now with newer connections that reminder, and the ability to do unique outreach based on the types of data the AI knows, is extremely valuable. but not with just boilerplate, and not with just texts."

---

## On Why LinkedIn Falls Short

"i think that is where linkedin falls short. i think ping needs to sort of find the right medium of user experience. sort of be the snapchat for business people of generation z. be able to send people short, meaningful video and voice messages with real interaction, body language, and implicit meaning you simply lose over text."

---

## On Growth Goals

"the goal is both more contacts and deeper relationships with existing, and that is sort of derived from/up to the user. can be both, or can be one at a time. can depend on the phase of life. looking for a job? hookups? cofounder? artists? life partner? hiring? friends? etc."

---

## On Rule of 6 Connections

"i do think that the whole rule of 6 connections to anyone on earth is very true for high agency people, and that with the right data and UX, this app can help achieve that for certain people."

---

## The Runway CEO Story (Verbatim)

"a great example is reece and I both having been in AI since first year undergrad, and both using runway going back to 2022. more recently, we found out our professor(close peer and mentor/friend we get drinks with, innovator etc), is interviewing the CEO. i am building some cool world model shit. i also went to the liquid AI launch event in boston two years back. reece and I were at dinner the other night, at a brazilian steakhouse, hear some guys to our left mentioning some friend of theirs works at liquid. they're wearing rolexes, so i was a bit perplexed and asked what they did. turns out one of them(the only interesting one, named hassan), is an engineer at runway and also lives in NYC and works on world models, and knows chris, the ceo of runway. super cool connection. we talked startups, future of ai, noise on twitter, had some laughs and a drink, and reece hit him with the ping ring to his phone. we made the connection. see what i mean? now we have 2 steps toward the Runway Ceo/founder, and could probably easily find that third and last connection depending on our goal. for reece he was asking hassan about the educational partnerships runway does, since thats his intentions, supporting our undergrad ai lab. my intentions are more focused on the future of world modelling, and that would be a different end goal. i want ping to be the connection god app. the snapchat of this generation if it had a baby with linkedin and apple(since there is hardware)."

---

## On Patent

"the end goal of the ux, *patent just submitted for this*, is to have a ring to ring connection where two people with ping rings shake hands and they auto connect with a 'ping!' sound effect."

---

## On Discovery/Search Concerns

"that screen/element doesnt exist yet. we havent decided. because on linkedin its sort of too much noise. randoms connect with low intention of ever actually following up. i think you have to have stated intention and have a message to send that person with a 'goal' tag for the interaction so that each connection is high quality. and intentions are clearer. time is more valued."

---

## On Health Scoring

"also relationship health should be a compound score. we should have different compound score algorithms for different connection types maybe? or maybe not. maybe the algo just has different active variables/weights, some get deactivated for certain tags/relationship types. like obviously an investment banking connection should be scored on different metrics than my 'hoes' circle of girls i'm interested in."

---

## On UX/Design Direction

"also i think way more of the UX needs to be done in a design thinking way, with more thoughtful and more overall three.js for real interaction representation. might need to create a spec where all screens are mapped for the app so we can sort of zoom out and understand the entire vision for ourselves. maybe redesign some screens."

## Technical Note: MCP Integration

From Poke/Interaction screenshot:
- Connect custom agents via MCP integration system
- poke.com/settings/connections/integrations/new for custom integrations
- Need MCP server endpoint for agents
- Documentation at poke.com/mcp (sparse, improving)

"There is an MCP for every type of data/interaction, and I can get my hands on almost any of them."
